## 📄 Description  

Amaze is a web application that lets users track Amazon product prices and stock availability over time.  
Users can submit a product URL or ASIN, view product details, price history, reviews, and stock status.  
Price-watch thresholds can be set, and email notifications are sent when prices drop or products are back in stock.
